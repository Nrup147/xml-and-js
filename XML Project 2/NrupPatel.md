- In this project I created the connect to the api and made a simplified version of the project.
- In the beginning I made a html and a js file that used the Words API and found out the definition of the word that was entered inside the search bar.
- I made two functions 
    * One being the onsubmit form button event which accepted the value input.
    * Second being the one that connected the API using the fetch request and Async Await function. In this I got the information from the API then converted it into a JSON file and then printed the Array that was returned using the map funtion.
