- Thought Process: 
1. Through the assignment the major task was to figure out the right nesting that had to be taken care of while creating the XSL file, in which there had to be multiple loops added.
2. Looking at the assignment.xml file I had to first make a skeleton of the table-in-table while aking sure that right sizes are placed under the right name heads and also that each size had to come in a different row. Figureing out this was the most time consuming as I could not think of a way to do it and when I figured it out I was so disappointed as it was the easiest out of all.
3. I had to make sure that the cells for the sizes which are not consisted in the switch case had to be kept empty and for that I used empty 'td' tags so as to keep it empty.
